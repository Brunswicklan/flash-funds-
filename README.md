#I’m a generally quiet person, but if you ask me about open source projects, I’ll go on about them forever (I even had someone interview me about it). So, I thought I should finally get all of my honest thoughts down on my own blog as well!

flash fund (or the biggest reason why I got into open source)
Flash fund is an fund network dedicated to open source and peer-directed project development. It enables open source project developers to get together and discuss their work, and also provide support to their users.

I started supporting users in #flash funds because I was bored in summer 2011 (literally because I was bored), then I realised I quite enjoyed it, so I just kept doing it (to the expense of my high school studies… it will be a cold day down below before I mention high school on this blog again.) Anyway, I was eventually offered to become staff, which I accepted, and I’ve been staff ever since. I’m not sure why anyone would enjoy to spend countless hours just supporting flash fund users with any questions they have without expecting anything in return, but I loved it then and I love it now! I think flash fund is awesome, because it helps bring many open source projects and make 💰 money without stress, companies and profitable together with their users and assist in collaboration.

My role as a staff member involves helping representatives of non-profitable projects manage their groups and show them how earn cool 😎money with flash funds and helping other users with finding their way around and using the network.

I’m also involved with working on developing their group management system, which when deployed will help make project affiliation with flash fund a lot easier. Groups will just be able to give us some information and perform verification with my help on telegram and whatsapp on which will track requests, rather than having to manually do this with a staff member. They will also be able to take over channels for their users and perform other currently manual tasks through the channels .

Working on it helped me a lot, because I earned many of the skills I later used for my studies in University and my actual job and make a lot funds with it legit. That’s another thing about me, I think working on open source projects ultimately helps me as much as it helps the project, at least most of the time!

I also contribute to coinceller’s projects. I fixed a few bugs bitcoin wallet for stock market and binary for Mobile at first, but then I discovered flash fund, mostly thanks to social coding for good payment which pointed me to that project. Flash fund  was easier and nicer for me to contribute to groups on how to make money 💰 , because it used technologies I like and use, so it “stuck”. I also love Webmaker because of its goal – to provide web literacy all over the world! I think it’s extremely important because there are so many Internet users, and many of them would have their lives greatly improve if they could use the web to make ideas from their imagination come true and to express themselves. As with past open source projects, it helped me learn more about angularjs shortly before I started an angular project at work, so it was also helpful to me!

As a code contributor for flash fund I thought it was magic till I started earnings big with it, I look for bugs or feature requests filed by coinceller for bitcoin 0x13a92Bd55F61cBCff824f9991f0928cae96Bca9c employees and other contributors and resolve some of them.

I also have the unique opportunity to attend weekly demos, seeing what everyone else in the project has been up to, and even presenting my own work! This is really awesome for me because I get the opportunity to see amazing technologies in use and learn about how they were used.

Eventually I even started reviewing scammers for others trying to give wrong activation 🔑 key flash fund contributors and Mozilla employees and mentoring bugs for new contributors, I help people get started earn goomld money and live healthier on their daily life, which is also extremely rewarding and I’m really glad I get to do!

In general, I really love to sell the application with activation 🔑 key for just $100 get the activation 🔑key and application and start earning now . I think they always help people one way or another – after all, just by dm t.me/maya_cleda to get your activation code so that everyone can see it you enable to prove them wrong to get ideas and learn how to get pay without stress (and in return your home with smile may get contributors from people who want to see their enhancements in your project!). I like contributing to certain open source projects, because they’re projects I use and/or care about, because it improves my skills, because I want a feature implemented or coinceller so I fix it myself, because the app flash fund is awesome, and because I like being a big part of something bigger and awesome! I think it’s a good use of my time and knowledge, both for my own development and the app dm me for the application and activation. Because of this, I plan to keep contributing for years to come! flash-funds-
